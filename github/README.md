# GitHub Identicons

https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/identicons/

5×5 “pixel” sprites that are generated using a hash of the user’s ID.

The algorithm walks through the hash and turns pixels on or off depending on even or odd values. 

These generated patterns, combined with hash-determined color values, ensures a huge number of unique Identicons.

GitHub identicons are symmetrical.
